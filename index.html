              Globally, the field of tortoises is attracting a growing amount of attention. While an infinitesimal minority 
              of carnivorous beings are intent on eradicating these vanishing species of marine turtles for their flesh and
              shells, a preponderant majority of peace-loving individuals in many nations are eager to protect the turtle<br> and 
              provide them with safe havens.Approximately 190 million years ago, marine turtles roamed the seas. 
              Existing today are only eight of the many distinct varieties of this ancient reptile species.<br>

                Sri Lanka is renowned for five species of turtles that breed on its sandy shores in the South Western and South 
                Eastern regions, from Induruwa to Yala and Kandakuliya in the Puttalam district.<br>
              </div>
              <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
              Turtles repose at Induruwa, Kosgoda, Akurala, Mavela, Rekava, and Kahanda Modera along the southwestern coast. 
              Turtles are located on the south-eastern beaches of Usangoda, Ambalantota, Bundala, and Yala.

        <ul id="list">
          <li>Participate in their educational turtle conservation tour to increase your knowledge of sea turtles. </li>
          <li>As a responsible visitor, you should not turn on the lighting of your DSLR cameras or cell phones, as female sea turtles prefer to nest in dark and quiet areas.</li>
          <li> Do not attempt to feed any of these animals, as doing so could make them susceptible to unanticipated infections and diseases.</li>
          <li> During your visit to the hatchery, please do not pollute the area with plastic bags. This is the worst possible scenario, as the sea turtles may mistake your luggage for their food source.</li>
          <li>Maintain a safe distance away from sea turtle nesting sites.</li>
          <li>Ensure that your visit to the Sea Turtle Hatchery does not leave a carbon footprint.</li>

              <p>Sri Lanka is quite unique in the fact that the country has sea turtles nesting all year round - hence the
                programme having start dates throughout the year. However, the peak sea turtle nesting season starts from the end of November 
                until the end of March, with the peak hatching season running from the start of February until the end of May. Although 
                you will more than likely see sea turtles and hatchlings outside of the peak months, it is not guaranteed and will be less
                frequent.

              <div class="subs">Top destination</div>
              <p>Sri Lanka is widely considered by our volunteers to be our best volunteer destination. The majority of our 
                feedback suggests that this is due to the superior local support offered by Charith and our local team, the volunteer programmes
                making a real difference, value for money and accommodation location. With this in mind, we believe that Sri Lanka is the perfect
                destination for first-time travellers, under 18's and families with younger children.

              <div class="subs">Weekends and free time </div>
              <p>You will have every weekend off from volunteering and this is the perfect time to explore everything this
                beautiful island has to offer. You are more than welcome to simply relax around the accommodation and enjoy the nearby beaches,
                but most volunteers will use this time to travel and see the country. If you are looking to see as much of the country as possible during 
                this time, travel with other volunteers and be accompanied by one of our local team members, then you may be interested in one
                or more of the organised weekend trips we run.
